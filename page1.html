    <p style= "color:white"> Freddy is an animatronic killer bear and the main antagonist of the game. He will only start being active from the third night and will ONLY ever come from the left door. Freddy is extremely unpredictable and deadly. The best way to avoid Freddy is to constantly keep an eye on him through the cameras and pray to God he doesn't try to sneak up on you. If he does sneak into your officeâ€¦..consider immediate medical attention.
