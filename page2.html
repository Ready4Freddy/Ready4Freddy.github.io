    <p style= "color:white"> Bonnie is an animatronic bunny and is simply adorable. He likes cookies, cuddling and gauging out your insides and stuffing a metal endoskeleton down your throat. He can only come at you through the left door so be sure to check it often. Looking for him through the cameras is not necessary as he has a tendency to teleport. Just make sure he is not outside your door and you will be fine.
