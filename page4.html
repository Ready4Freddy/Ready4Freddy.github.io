    <p style= "color:white"> Foxy is a fox that is very shy. If you keep checking on his location with the camera he will be too shy to come out. If you do not do this however he will come running for you. If you see that he is gone CLOSE THE LEFT DOOR EMEDIATLY because you are about to die. If you regularly check on him however, this will not be a problem.
